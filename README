Test of lightcurve computation for a general triangular mesh.

The following physics was already implemented:

- insolation
- shadowing (non-convex), eclipses, transits, ...
- visibility (mutual)
- scatterring (mutual)
- Lambert law
- above-horizon test
- simplified motion
- lightcurve

2DO list:

- Lommel-Seeliger law
- Hapke law
- bounding-box test
- body rotation
- 2D mesh projection
- 2D vector product
- synthetic image (AO)
- integration with Xitau?
